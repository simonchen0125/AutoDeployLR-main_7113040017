# Project Execution Report

**Date:** September 20, 2025

**Objective:** To successfully run the Streamlit application located in `app.py`.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Initial Attempt to Run:** I first attempted to run the Streamlit application using the command `streamlit run app.py &` to execute it in the background.
2.  **Connection Refused Error:** Upon checking, it was evident that the application was not accessible, and a `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error was reported.
3.  **Diagnosis of the Issue:** Further investigation revealed that the `streamlit run` command was being blocked by an interactive prompt requesting an email address for onboarding. This prevented the application from starting correctly in the background.
4.  **Resolution:** To bypass the interactive email prompt, I executed the command `echo '' | streamlit run app.py &`. This piped an empty string as input to the `streamlit run` command, allowing it to proceed without user intervention.
5.  **Verification:** I confirmed that the Streamlit process is now actively running in the background using `ps aux | grep streamlit`.

**Current Status:**

The Streamlit application is successfully running in the background.

**Access URL:**

You can access the application at: `http://localhost:8501`
